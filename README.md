## Hello there ðŸ‘‹
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on programming in C, Python and Java programming languages.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying an MSc in Computer Science at University of Bath.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects, I'm a very fast learner!
ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking to gain experience and apply Agile practices.

 ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: How to be a more effective public speaker or do I have a one or two-handed backhand?
